App Description
Baking App will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The recipe listing is located here:
https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/59121517_baking/baking.json.

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images you will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.
One of the skills that is demonstrated in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.
